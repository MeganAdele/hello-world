# hello-world
Hello! My name is Megan and I just learning how to code. I am from the region of California typically known as Silicon Valley. I was even a sub-contractor for Google at one point. However, on the salary of someone in the Hospitality industry, Silicon Valley was not very good to me. I moved to a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota almost a year ago now as part of a family exodus. I fell back into hospitality, but am more on the corporate side now. I'm leraning how to code in an effort to make a career change. At the end of the day, I get great satisfaction in helping people, but I need to help myself so I can help others.
